[TASK] Remove origuid column since it's not used anymore
Steffen Ritter gave me the hint, that origuid is not

[TASK] Adapt settings.yaml in fixtures

Without this file comparison in compatibility
test fails
[BUGFIX] Set correct default values in roundtrip mode
The class builder now sets correct default values for existing properties.

is NULL or an empty string or 0 (for numeric type) this patch adds a
configuration flag setDefaultValuesForClassProperties which can be set
to false to disable this behaviour (tbd)
Resolves: #58164

[TASK] Preparation for TER release

[TASK] Enable merging of xliff files
This patch enables "merging" of xliff localization files.
Manually added key/label pairs are preserved on rewriting
the files, but changes made in the modeler are applied.
When renaming a model or a property the old id/label is
not removed, since we would have to load all labels from
the previous version of the extension to identify renamed
items.
Support for xml format is dropped.
Resolves: #57688
[TASK] Enable FAL related property types
The FAL integration in extbase is still quite incomplete.
This patch enables adding files or images as properties.
A property of type file or image is in fact a relation.
But if you create a relation to sys_file_reference in the
modeler, you won't get the appropriate form element for
adding a reference or uploading files in the Backend.
So this patch adds a property of type file_reference if
maxItems is 1 and a 1:n relation (ObjectStorage),
if maxItems is > 1.
The folder property, is dropped since it is not
supportd by FAL. Instead a relation to sys_file_collection
could be added as usual.
Resolves: #57791
[TASK] Remove old doc/manual.sxw
[TASK] Include new Extension Manual
Resolves: #57853
[TASK] Enable property type specific options

[BUGFIX] Make Extension Builder work with current master
In the current TYPO3 master branch (6.2) all modules
require a module token to avoid CSRF attacks.
Because of that, we need to change the smd endpoint
URL to be dynamic to generate the target URL
properly.
The change will make it work in master branch
but is still compatible with older TYPO3 versions.
Resolves: #56465
[TASK] Integrate PHP-Parser
Use PHP-Parser based on tokenizer.
Single line comments are now restricted to appear before
nodes, otherwise they will be lost.
Needs still extensive testing to cover more possible coding
styles.
In general the handling of whitespaces and comments is sometimes
difficult; I adapted the printer to keep linebreaks in array
definitions and in method parameters
Resolves: #55686
[FEATURE] Open in new window link
