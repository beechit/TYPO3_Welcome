				<source>Owners can also add and delete other owners. If a user is allowed to create workspaces himself he will automatically become the initial owner user of the workspace. They are also the only ones who can eventually publish the workspace content (except general TYPO3 "admin" users) and thus the highest review authority (unless members/reviewers have access to the Live workspace).</source>

			<trans-unit id="reviewers.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>In case you need no review layer between editors (normally workspace "members") and the workspace owners what you simply do is to add all editors as reviewers. This give them access to raise content all the way to the workspace owners. Since content is by default raised from editing to review to publish state it even gives the possibility of informal "four-eye" review where workspace owners can require that content has  been raised by action from two different reviewers.</source>

				<source>"Notify users on next stage only": When content is raised from "Editing" to "Review", reviewers are notified. When content is raised to "Publish", owners are notified.

"Notify all users on any change" : All users in workspace are notified regardless of change.</source>

				<source>Any DB mount specified here must be inside the DB mount set for the backend user who logs in. If that is not the case the workspace DB mount will simply not be mounted for the user. If no DB mounts are specified for the workspace the users will access the DB mounts of their user profile.</source>

				<source>Filemounts available for workspace users. Please see details for security information!</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="file_mountpoints.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>IMPORTANT: By default a draft workspace has all filemounts disabled! This is because versioning does not apply to any files edited through filemounts in TYPO3. Hence any access to those files would violate the principle that no content managed in a draft workspace will be live before published.
However, for specific projects this violation might be acceptable or necessary and therefore you can add a filemount. This will be forced upon any user in the workspace regardless of his filemounts inherited from his groups and user profile!</source>

			<trans-unit id="unpublish_time.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>By "additional" is meant that both publishing times are used in a similar way, but if "Publish" is specified it takes precedence over "Unpublish". Anyway, the point of two publishing times is that workspace content could be swapped in for a limited period and then out again. But notice; for this to work the Swap mode must be set to "Swap-Into-Workspace on Auto-publish".</source>

				<source>By default swapping is allowed. Thereby two versions can be published "in and out" of a workspace multiple times, always substituting each other. If this is not desired, it can be disabled with "Disable Swap-Into-Workspace".
Another mode "Swap-Into-Workspace on Auto-publish" will force the automatic publishing through the cronjob to swap versions. This is necessary to use if you specify both a publish AND un-publish time because otherwise the workspace will be empty after the first publish action!</source>

				<source>"Element" is the most common form of versioning where a single element is versionized solo.
"Page" is a versioning type where a page record and child records from specified tables (like "Content Elements" and "Language Overlay Records") are copied along. This form is more complex but offers flexibility in terms of rearrangement of elements on the page.
"Branch" versioning is where a page is versionized and all subpages and content is copied along. This can have quite heavy implications on data duplication and is recommended only in special circumstances.

More information about versioning types can be read in "Inside TYPO3"</source>
