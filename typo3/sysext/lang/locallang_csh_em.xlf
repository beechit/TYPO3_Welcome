				<source>TYPO3 can be extended in nearly any direction without loosing backwards compatibility. The Extension API provides a powerful framework for easily adding, removing, installing and developing such extensions to TYPO3. This is in particular powered by the Extension Manager (EM) inside TYPO3.

"Extensions" is a term in TYPO3 which covers two other terms, plugins and modules.

A plugin is something that plays a role on the website itself. For example a board, guestbook, shop etc. It is normally enclosed in a PHP class and invoked through a USER or USER_INT cObject from TypoScript. A plugin is an extension in the frontend.

A module is a backend application which has it's own position in the administration menu. It requires backend login and works inside the framework of the backend. We might also call something a module if it exploits any connectivity of an existing module, that is if it simply adds itself to the function menu of existing modules. A module is an extension in the backend.</source>

To de-install an extension you simply click the green "-" icon. If there are no dependencies requiring the extension it will be removed from the list of installed extensions.
The "Rq" extensions in the loaded extensions list are "required extensions". These are related so deeply to the system that you cannot disable them from the Extension Manager.</source>

If you click the install icon ("+") of an extension you might end in a dialog like this. In this case a new database table is required. The Extension Manager will automatically detect that it does not exist yet and suggest that you create it.

				<source>Importing Extensions</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="import.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>This is the process of bringing the files of an extension to the servers filesystem. You can do this either by importing from a repository at a URL (usually from TER; TYPO3 Extension Repository at typo3.org) or by uploading a "t3x" file which someone else created from the Extension Manager on another server.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="import.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>&lt;b&gt;Import from TER&lt;/b&gt;
To connect to the TER you simply click the button "Connect to online repository". This will request the URL shown in the text above the button and the URL should return a list of available extension you can import.
If you know what you are looking for then enter a search word in the look-up box. In particular this helps you to look up a specific extension key. The connection to TER will be much faster if you use this since less data is sent over the wire!

&lt;b&gt;Upload from file&lt;/b&gt;
For private projects the exchange of extensions is easily done by sending "t3x" files from system to system. In one TYPO3 installation you simply go to the menu "Backup/Delete" of an extension and download a "Backup" of the extension. The fileformat is a serialized PHP array, compressed if possible. This file can then be uploaded in the Extension Manager of another TYPO3 system where you want to import it.</source>

If an extension does not yet exist on your server you will see the icon with the red arrow next to that extension. A single click and the extension will be downloaded and the files extracted on your server. The download directory is seen if you move the mouse over the icon (in the tool-tip text).

&lt;b&gt;Update Extensions&lt;/b&gt;
You can update extensions that are always on your system by clicking the icon with the green arrows. The update icon will appear if the "minor" version number (middle digit) has been incremented. This means that extensions updated on the dev-version number (the third digit) will not be shown as "ready for update". (You can configure TYPO3 to do that though!).

&lt;b&gt;Seeing details about an extension in TER&lt;/b&gt;
You can also click the title of an extension to see details about it. That will also allow you to perform a more detailed update operation where you can select version number and download location (local/global/system).
You can also ask to have the most recent translations downloaded.</source>

If you clicked the title of an extension you will request the repository for details about the extension. This also allows you to select a specific version for import.

The list will include the findings of this analysis and if any errors were found they will be displayed.

				<source>The files for an extension are located in a folder named by the extension key. The location of this folder can be either inside typo3conf/ext/,  typo3/ext/ or typo3/sysext/. The extension must be programmed so that it automatically detects where it is located and can work from all three locations.

&lt;b&gt;Local location "typo3conf/ext/":&lt;/b&gt; This is where to put extensions which are local for a particular TYPO3 installation. The typo3conf/ directory is always local, containing local configuration (eg. localconf.php), local modules etc. If you put an extension here it will be available for this TYPO3 installation only. This is a "per-database" way to install an extension.

&lt;b&gt;Global location "typo3/ext/":&lt;/b&gt; This is where to put extensions which are global for the TYPO3 source code on the web server. These extensions will be available for any TYPO3 installation sharing the source code.
When you upgrade your TYPO3 source code you probably want to copy the typo3/ext/ directory from the former source to the new source, overriding the default directory. In this way all global extension you use will be installed inside the new sourcecode. After that you can always enter TYPO3 and upgrade the versions if needed.
This is a "per-server" way to install an extension.

&lt;b&gt;System location "typo3/sysext/":&lt;/b&gt; This is system default extensions which cannot and should not be updated by the EM. They are distributed with the TYPO3 core.


&lt;b&gt;Loading precedence&lt;/b&gt;
Local extensions take precedence which means that if an extension exists both in typo3conf/ext/ and typo3/ext/ the one in typo3conf/ext/ is loaded. Likewise global extension takes predence over system extensions. This means that extensions are loaded in the order of priority local-global-system.
In effect you can therefore have, say, a "stable" version of an extension installed in the global dir (typo3/ext/) which is used by all your projects on a server sharing source code, but on a single experimental project you can import the same extension in a newer "experimental" version and for that particular project the locally available extension will be used instead.</source>

&lt;b&gt;TCA:&lt;/b&gt; The extension contains configuration of a table in $TCA.

&lt;b&gt;Plugin:&lt;/b&gt; The extension adds a frontend plugin to the plugin list in Content Element type "Insert Plugin".

&lt;b&gt;Plugin/ST43:&lt;/b&gt; TypoScript rendering code for the plugin is added to the static template "Content (default)". "Plugin" and "Plugin/ST43" are commonly used together.
