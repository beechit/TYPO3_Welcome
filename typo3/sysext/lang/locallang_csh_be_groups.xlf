When a user is a member of many groups (including sub-groups) then the permission settings are added together so that the more groups a user is a member of, the more access is granted to him.</source>

				<source>The page tree in TYPO3 must have some points-of-entry defined. Here you should insert one or more references to a page which will represent a new root page for the page tree. This is called a "Database mount" or "DB mount".
DB mounts &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; be inherited by the users which are members of this group. This depends on whether the user is configured to include the mounts set in the member groups.
However it's recommended to use backend user groups like this to configure mounts. Especially if they need to be shared among many users.</source>

				<source>The file folder tree is used by all File-submodules to navigate the file folders on the webserver. If you want users to access the servers file system through TYPO3 they need at least one File Mount (and access to eg. File &gt; Filelist module).
You can mount a path in "fileadmin/" relative to the TYPO3 installation or you can mount an absolute path somewhere else on the server (outside webroot!). The last requires that $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath] is defined. The path you mount is defined by the Filemount record you refer to by this field. So a File Mount just points to another record inside of which the details are configured. See screenshots below.
"admin" users always have the "fileadmin/" folder mounted by default.
Notice; as with 'DB mounts' the file folder mounts may be inherited by the users which are members of this group.</source>

				<source>The File Mounts are references to records from the "Filemounts" table.
In the Filemount record you define whether the path should be absolute (must be within $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath]) or relative to "fileadmin/". In this case the Filemount points to "fileadmin/user_upload/"
This is the page tree of the "admin" user. Notice the folder "user_upload" which is the folder referred to by the File Mount record.
This shows the mounted folder as seen by a user who was member of the group.
Filemount records are also created in the page tree root.</source>

				<source>"Allowed excludefields" allows you to detail the permissions granted to tables. By default all these fields are not available to users but must be specifically enabled by being selected here.
One application of this is that pages are usually hidden by default and that the hidden field is not available for a user unless he has been granted access by this list of "Allowed excludefields". So the user may create a new page, but cannot un-hide the page - unless of course he has been assigned the "Page: Hide page" exclude field through one of his member groups.
Of course it does not make any sense to add fields from tables which are not included in the list of tables allowed to be modified.</source>
