				<source>All visible content on webpages in TYPO3 is typically made by "Page content" records. They are typically referred to as "Content Elements". Often Content Elements are managed by the "Page" module which is designed to handle Content Elements in multiple columns and languages.</source>

			<trans-unit id=".details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>"Page content" records is ordered and can thus be rearranged. Also notice that the "Language" and "Column" selector of the "Page content" records determines where and in which situation they appear. If you do not change the value of the "Language" and "Column" selectors you are most sure that the element will appear by default.</source>

				<source>The Page module is used to manage Content Elements effectively as they appear arranged in columns and languages.
A Content Element has a large editing form with many options. The "Type" determines which options are visible.
In the frontend - on the webpage - a Content Element like the above could look like this.</source>

			<trans-unit id="CType.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Select the kind of page content this element represents. New options will appear when you save the record.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="CType.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The 'Type' of content you select determines which options you have in the editform, so make sure to save the record before you make changes.

This is a description of the various types:

&lt;strong&gt;Header&lt;/strong&gt;
This type allows you insert a standard content element header and nothing more.
Almost all the other types described below also includes the header with the exact same options. So the Header type just provides a way to insert a header &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; without anything else.

&lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt;
The Text type allows you to insert regular page content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text &amp; Images&lt;/strong&gt;
This is the same as the Text type (regular page content) but with the option of attaching images.

&lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt;
The same as Text &amp; Images but without the text field - so only images.

&lt;strong&gt;Bullet list&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create a bullet list. Each line in the text-field will appear as a single line in the bulletlist.

&lt;strong&gt;Table&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; tables. Each line represents a tablerow and vertical bars '|' separates each column.

&lt;strong&gt;Filelinks&lt;/strong&gt;
Allows you to present a list of files for download. You can have thumbnails attached to the list including filesize.

&lt;strong&gt;Multimedia&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you insert multimedia elements such as sound, video, java applets and flash animations.

&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create mail forms. There is a special syntax to use when you wish to create form fields.

&lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a search box and it will also display the search result if a query is performed to the page.

&lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays a login box for website users. You must create at least one Website user and user group before this makes any sense to use.

&lt;strong&gt;Textbox&lt;/strong&gt;
This is mainly for customly defined design which includes typically some text and an image. So in other words the function is not generally defined. However the default subtypes will let you choose various ways to display some text with an image.
Use only if instructed to.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu/Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Offers a selection of various link menus and a sitemap you can insert on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert records&lt;/strong&gt;
This is a placeholder for other records. In other words, by this element you can attach other content elements from elsewhere and thus insert them this page.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert plugin&lt;/strong&gt;
This will allow you to insert a forum, guestbook, list of addresses, shopping basket etc. The various features are available &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if they are configured correctly in the template of your website. So before you use it, make sure this is the case.

&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;
This is plain HTML content. Everything put here will be displayed directly on the page without any preprocessing.</source>

There are a number of default implementations depending on the content element type:

"Normal" will provide a list of filelinks with no thumbnail.
"Layout 1" adds a file icon to the left of the link

			<trans-unit id="bodytext.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Here you enter the body text of the content element. Usually you can use some HTML formatting tags, if you're using Internet Explorer you can even format the content visually.
The field is reused in most other types and so switching between the content element types will bring the value of this field with it.

When you're using this field with the "Text" and "Text &amp; Images" types, the content is used as ordinary body text. Each linebreak normally signifies a new paragraph, you can use the special TYPO3 tag, &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt;, for making links. You can use many HTML tags but there are limitations as well. This will depend on the implementation.

&lt;b&gt;Bulletlists:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Bulletlist" each line in this field is a bulletlist entry.

&lt;b&gt;Tables:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Table" each line represents a table row. Within each line you divide the columns by inserting a vertical bar, |. So making a table row with 3 columns could look like "This is column 1 | Column 2 here | Third column!". Use the table wizard for creating tables - that is much easier than "coding" them.

&lt;b&gt;Parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
Types like "Script", "Form" and "Multimedia" use this field for parameters you can pass to the element. And the "HTML" type accepts any input as raw HTML which is simply displayed on the website without any preprocessing.

&lt;strong&gt;Rich Text Editor:&lt;/strong&gt;
With the types "Text" and "Text &amp; Images" the Rich Text editor is used for editing if your browser supports it and the editor is generally enabled in the system. Be aware that the content is "cleansed" before it goes into the database when you're using the "Text" and "Text &amp; Images" types.

&lt;b&gt;Making a mail form:&lt;/b&gt;
When you have selected the content element type "Form" you should enter lines of parameters into this field. This is a brief example:

Your name: | *name=input,40 | [Enter name!]
Your email: | *email=input,40
Your address: | address=textarea,40,10
Your haircolor: |hair=radio|Blue=blue, Red=red

|formtype_mail = submit | Send form
|subject=hidden| Enter a subject here!
|html_enabled=hidden | 1

The first two lines makes input-fields for name and email, both are marked "required" by the * and the name field has a default value of "[Enter name!]".
The third line is a text box and the fourth makes radiobuttons to select haircolor.
Then there are three important lines in the end. The first makes a submit button with the label "Send form", the second line is the subject of the email the receiver gets and the third line makes the form result render in an HTML-table.
It is much easier to use the Form Wizard for creating forms.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; Before any form will ever work, you must enter a recipient email address. The "Recipient-email:" field is used for that (this is in fact the Subheader field used!).</source>

				<source>You can attach images to the content element and almost as many as you like.
Depending on the configuration of TYPO3 you can even attach them in any format you like. Especially you do not need to worry about size and compression because these factors are normally handled by TYPO3 internally.

When you use the "Text &amp; Images" type, it's important to select a proper position of the image block. For this purpose, use the Position selector which is displayed below (or if you click in the image list field in the Classic backend). See link to "Page content / Position" below.
You can also display images in multiple columns and enable an option which enables a link so you can click the image and see a bigger version. Just to name a few options.
Most likely you don't have all options available. This depends on your permissions in the system.</source>

			<trans-unit id="imageorient.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>The position above and below the body text is pretty straight forward.
The options "In text" means that the image block is displayed with text aside it. When you select this option the template will probably force the images into smaller dimensions because they cannot take up the same space when text is supposed to float around them.
When you select "In text" you can choose the options either above or below the divider "No wrap". If you select the "In text" option above, the bodytext will float &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the image block when the bodytext reaches the end of the image block. So in other words the body text &lt;em&gt;wraps around&lt;/em&gt; the image block. If you select "In text" below the "No wrap" divider, the body text will not float under the image block, but simply continue in its column.
Apart from the visual difference there is a technical aspect as well. Because if you choose to allow the content to wrap the image block you will experience a strange phenomenon when you do not have enough bodytext to make it float around the image: You experience that the subsequent content elements on the page is somehow layered on top of the image block - and this certainly looks like a bug. However it's easily solved by changing the "In text" position to the equal value but below the "No wrap" divider.</source>

				<source>With this field you can generally create a relation to a page (or more) in TYPO3. This field is used by many of the content element types. If you don't specify a page here, the current page will generally be used.

Using the "Search" type, the page you insert will be the page to which the search is targeted. You must make sure that this page has a similar "Search" content element (or something similar) to render a search result. Else it makes no sense.

The "Login" type content element also uses this field to direct the login to a certain page. However that page does not need to contain a Login content element in order to perform the authentication - you can in fact submit a login request to any TYPO3 page and it will be evaluated!
If you specify a second page in this list, the id will be passed to the login system as being the page inside TYPO3 where the database of users to look up is found. You should use this only if your template is not configured to pass this value on.
In order for the login procedure to work, you must make sure that 1) you have created at least one Website user and member usergroup and is using the correct username and password, 2) you have configured in your TypoScript template on which page (typically a SysFolder) the users can be found - or alternatively have specified this by the second page in the this page list, 3) cookies must be enabled.

The "Menu/Sitemap" element also uses this field. In that case the page(s) will determine from which point the menu is drawn or maybe even represent the actual pages to which the menu links. All this depends on the subtype of Menu/Sitemap you have selected.

Finally the "Form" element uses this field as the page to which the form is submitted. You might thus insert a page which is the "Thank you" page of the form mail.</source>

				<source>Select which kind of menu you wish to create.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="menu_type.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>This is a short description of each type:

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of these pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This will create a list of links to the pages you insert in the Startingpoint list.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This results in a list of links to the subpages of the pages in the Startingpoint list. If you do not specify a startingpoint, subpages to the current page will be selected.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous, but this will include the content of the Abstract field of the pages.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages + sections&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous, but including 'submenu' links to all content elements on the page which has the "Index" checkbox set.

&lt;strong&gt;Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Generates a classic tree sitemap. Maybe your TypoScript template is configured to another design of the sitemap, but anyhow you'll get a sitemap out of this. Notice that the sitemap will begin from the current page unless you specify another "Startingpoint" page in the list below.

&lt;strong&gt;Section index (page content w/Index checked)&lt;/strong&gt;
This makes a menu to the content elements on this page (or the page specified in the Starting point list). Great way to make an index in the top of the page.
Notice that all content elements with the "Index" checkbox set is selected. So if you don't want certain content elements to appear in the list, just un-check the Index checkbox for those elements.

&lt;strong&gt;Recently updated pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This displays the 10 most recently updated pages.
&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; If you update a page and this list seems not to be updated instantly, just clear the cache of the page and the problem is solved.

&lt;strong&gt;Related pages (based on keywords)&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays other related pages based on the keywords set for this page matched up with the keywords on other pages.


&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; With many of the above menu types, the default starting point is the current page. However you can specify another startingpoint (or more than one in fact!) by adding pages to the "Startingpoint" list. See link below.</source>
