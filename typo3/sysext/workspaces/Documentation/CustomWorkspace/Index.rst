   Starting the creation of a new custom workspace


- Choose "Workspace" in the wizard

- Fill in the form – most fields are self-explaining (for the user
  rights see chapter above)

- Add as many stages as you may need (Without any custom stages you will
  have "Edit" and "Ready to Publish")

- Either you just define responsible persons or you further define the
  default notification recipients (these are checked by default in the
  change stage window)

- By disabling the checkbox "Allow notification settings during stage
  change" you are able to hide the recipient suggestions in the change
  stage window
