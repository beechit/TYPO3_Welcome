Administration
--------------

The extension should be installed as usual using TYPO3 Extension
Manager. Notice that this extension can work only as a system
extension. It requires at least TYPO3 6.2 and PHP 5.3.7.

After installation OpenID identifiers should be added to the Frontend
and Backend user records who need to authenticate themselves using
OpenID. See the "Configuration" section later in this manual for more
information.
