Users manual
------------

There are no user–configurable options for this extension. Once
installed OpenID authentication becomes available to users
automatically.

When using OpenID for authentication, user needs only to write his
OpenID in the "User name" field. The password box is ignored when
using OpenID. If login form requires a password, user can type any
random sequence of characters there. These characters will not affect
OpenID authentication.

Normal authentication works in parallel with OpenID authentication:
user can use OpenID or their normal TYPO3 login. Administrators can
force users to use OpenID only by generating random long passwords for
users.
