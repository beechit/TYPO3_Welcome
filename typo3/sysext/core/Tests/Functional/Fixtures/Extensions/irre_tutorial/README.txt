-----------------------------
 1. Installation
---------------------------
Download the extension "irre_tutorial" from the TYPO3 Extension Repository at http://www.typo3.org/
Install the extension using the Extension Manager (EM) in the TYPO3 Backend. You need administrative
rights (admin user) at your TYPO3 installation to be able to do this.

After this extension was installed, a new backend module "Web>IRRE Tutorial" will appear. By clicking
on the module link in the left menu frame, you can import a set of sample data.

To uninstall the sample data you have to select "Uninstall sample data" from the upper right corner
in the "IRRE Tutorial" module. The script looks for a page alias "irre_tutorial_data" and removes, if
successfully found, this branch from your TYPO3 installation.



-----------------------------
 2. Usage
---------------------------
After you imported the IRRE Tutorial sample data, you are can play around, change tca.php files etc.
You can just do, what ever you'd like to. The ext_tables.php and tca.php have a additional string in
their filenames. This should help you to find the case you're looking fore faster. See the following
description what these strings (e.g. like "tx_irretutorial_<string>_hotel or tca.<string>.php) mean:

	* 1ncsv: 1:n relations using comma separated values as list
	* 1nff: 1:n relations using foreign_field as pointer on child table
	* mnasym: m:n bidirectional asymmetric relations using intermediate table
	* mnsym: m:n bidirectional symmetric relations using intermediate table
	* mnattr: m:n bidirectional asymmetric attributed relations using intermediate table
	* mnmmasym: m:n bidirectional asymmetric relations using the default MM feature of TYPO3
