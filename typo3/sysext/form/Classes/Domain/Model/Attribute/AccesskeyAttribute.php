	 * Gets the attribute 'accesskey'.
	 * Used with the element 'button, input, label, legend, textarea'
	 * Not subject to case changes
	 *
	 * This attribute assigns an access key to an element.
	 * An access key is a single character from the document character set.
	 * Note. Authors should consider the input method of the expected reader
	 * when specifying an accesskey.
	 *
	 * Pressing an access key assigned to an element gives focus to the element.
	 * The action that occurs when an element receives focus depends on the element.
	 * For example, when a user activates a link defined by the A element,
	 * the user agent generally follows the link. When a user activates a radio
	 * button, the user agent changes the value of the radio button.
	 * When the user activates a text field, it allows input, etc.
	 *
	 * @return string Attribute value
