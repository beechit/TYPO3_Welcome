	 * This attribute specifies the base language of an element's attribute

	 *
	 * Briefly, language codes consist of a primary code
	 * and a possibly empty series of subcodes:
	 *
	 * language-code = primary-code ( "-" subcode )
	 *
	 * Here are some sample language codes:
	 * "en": English
	 * "en-US": the U.S. version of English.
	 * "en-cockney": the Cockney version of English.
	 * "i-navajo": the Navajo language spoken by some Native Americans.
	 * "x-klingon": The primary tag "x" indicates an experimental language tag
	 *
	 * @return string Attribute value
