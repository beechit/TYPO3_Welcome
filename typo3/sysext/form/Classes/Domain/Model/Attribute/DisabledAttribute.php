	 * Case Insensitive
	 *
	 * When set for a form control, this boolean attribute disables the control
	 * for user input.
	 *
	 * When set, the disabled attribute has the following effects on an element:
	 * Disabled controls do not receive focus.
	 * Disabled controls are skipped in tabbing navigation.
	 * Disabled controls cannot be successful.
	 *
	 * This attribute is inherited but local declarations override the inherited value.
	 *
	 * How disabled elements are rendered depends on the user agent.
	 * For example, some user agents "gray out" disabled menu items,
	 * button labels, etc.
	 *
	 * @return string Attribute value
