	 * This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which it is set.
	 * Unlike the TITLE element, which provides information about an entire
	 * document and may only appear once, the title attribute may annotate any
	 * number of elements. Please consult an element's definition to verify that
	 * it supports this attribute.
	 *
	 * Values of the title attribute may be rendered by user agents in a variety
	 * of ways. For instance, visual browsers frequently display the title as a
	 * "tool tip" (a short message that appears when the pointing device pauses
	 * over an object). Audio user agents may speak the title information in a
	 * similar context.
