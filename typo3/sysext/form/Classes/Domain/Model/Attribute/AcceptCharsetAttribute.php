	 * The value is a space- and/or comma-delimited list of charset values.
	 * The client must interpret this list as an exclusive-or list, i.e.,
	 * the server is able to accept any single character encoding per entity received.

	 * The default value for this attribute is the reserved string "UNKNOWN".
	 * User agents may interpret this value as the character encoding that was
	 * used to transmit the document containing this FORM element.
	 *
	 * RFC2045: For a complete list, see http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/
	 *
	 * @todo Perhaps we once can add a list of all character-sets to TYPO3
