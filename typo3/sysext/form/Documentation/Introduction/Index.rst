What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension allows users to easily build forms using a drag and
drop interface. A WYSIWYG view simplifies the process of building a
form, and relatively non-technical editors can easily add validation
rules on a field-by-field basis (e.g., email or alphanumeric
validation).
