The Salted user password hashes extension derives from TYPO3 extension
t3sec\_saltedpw, originally developed by Marcus Krause. This extension
is still available in the `TYPO3 extension repository <http://typo3.or
g/extensions/repository/view/t3sec_saltedpw/current/>`_ (TER) for
users of TYPO3 Core 4.2.X. For a listing of contributors to the
original version, please have a look at the credits chapter of
t3sec\_saltedpw's extension manual.

A lot of clean up and optimization was done during core integration. A
tremendous effort has been made by Steffen Ritter. Furthermore, Oliver
Hader (TYPO3 Core Team), Sascha Kettler and Marcus Krause (TYPO3
Security Team) made a good amount of code contribution which allowed
it to integrate the extension in TYPO3 Core.

Despite a rewrite of this extension, older passwords generated by
extension t3sec\_saltedpw are still compatible with this system
extension.
