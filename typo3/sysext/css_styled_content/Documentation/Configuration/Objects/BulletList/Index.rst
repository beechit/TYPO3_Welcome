Bullet list
"""""""""""

The bullet list-type content element is rendered using a simple
:ref:`t3tsref:cobj-text` object applied to the "bodytext" field.
The :ref:`split <t3tsref:split>` function is used to split
the content into individual lines on each line break. Odd and
even lines are marked with a different class.

.. note::

   The rendering will produce only unordered lists.
