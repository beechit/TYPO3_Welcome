				In this panel it is possible to select a configuration preset which optimizes multiple settings
				to be suited best for production or development environments.
				The "Production" preset configures your TYPO3 installation for maximum performance
				and suppresses debug and error messages, so that nothing is disclosed to website visitors.
				The "Development" preset enables most debug and error messages which is helpful during development.
				As a third option it is possible to manually customize each setting for specific needs.
