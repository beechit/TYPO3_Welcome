Content
===============================================================================

This is the repository for extensions which are shipped with the core. They are
regular extensions with the difference that they are not available on the TYPO3
Extension Repository (TER), but instead are part of the Core packages.

Since they are shipped with the TYPO3 Core (typo3_src package), their content
will change when updating the Core. They are packaged together with the Core
by the release team, so updating the Core will update these extensions too.

Git Repository
===============================================================================

These extensions are developed by the Active Contributors and are
maintained directly in the main Core Git repository:
