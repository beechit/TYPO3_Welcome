Doing the actual setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now fire up a browser and visit your new TYPO3 install – you should
get redirected to the install tool in 1-2-3 mode. Fill in the database
connection parameters and you should get a list of present databases
to choose from (if any exist and are accessible to the user entered).
If everything went well up to this point, just continue as usual.

If the 1-2-3 more doesn't work, just go to the regular mode and work
your way through the setup.

**Try not to create a database from within the install tool,** this
doesn't work anyway (and it probably never will).
