The component "Bootstrap DateTimePicker" was downloaded from

http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/

and is licensed under MIT.

It is used by the TYPO3 Backend as DateTime Widget in
EXT:Scheduler and FormEngine, using .less and the minified
bootstrap js file as un-named AMD module.

Please note that this is a 3rd party library. If you e.g. need
the styles, feel free to use the CSS file directly. However,
be aware that these files might be moved during the CMS 7
development to be fetched via Composer and be put in a different
directory.
