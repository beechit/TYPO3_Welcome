	/**
	 * Instances receive a callback from GoEngine after each update cycle, 
	 * allowing managers to more easily perform ongoing processes during animation. 
	 * 
	 * <p><font color="#CC0000">[This is a more advanced manager interface, so if 
	 * you are just getting started with Go's management system it is suggested that 
	 * you focus on <code>IManager</code> & <code>IManageable</code>, and save this 
	 * section for when you need it.]</font> </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Hypothetical examples:</p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>An updater class that refreshes (rerenders) a 3D scene after all 
	 * animations have processed each pulse.</li>
	 * <li>A hitTest manager that allows all items to update their positions 
	 * first, then tests for hits between them.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>Each <code>ILiveManager</code> receives a special onUpdate() callback 
	 * after GoEngine completes each pulse cycle for any particular pulseInterval. 
	 * This callback receives three things: the pulseInterval associated with the 
	 * cycle, an array containing the items updated, and the synced current-time value 
	 * that was sent to all the items as update() was called. (Background: GoEngine 
	 * stores different lists for every different pulseInterval specified by animation 
	 * items. Usually users will stick to a single pulseInterval but at times it can 
	 * be beneficial to run some animations slower than others â€“ such as the readouts 
	 * in a spaceship game's cockpit which don't need to refresh as often and can free 
	 * up processing power for the game if they don't.)</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The list of updated items only includes items actually updated, which at 
	 * times can differ slightly from the items that have been added to GoEngine and 
	 * sent to the manager's reserve() method. (Background: when items are added to 
	 * GoEngine during its update cycle, it defers updating them until the next pulse 
	 * so as not to disrupt the cycle in progress.) Therefore, even though <code>ILiveManager</code> 
	 * extends <code>IManager</code> and contains reserve() and release() methods, 
	 * those methods are often not needed here, since you can filter and make use of 
	 * the incoming array of updated items on each update. This can also relieve such 
	 * managers from needing to store and manage complex handler lists (as 
	 * <code>OverlapMonitor</code> does).</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><code>ILiveManager</code> instances registered using <code>GoEngine.addManager()</code> 
	 * are stored in an ordered list. You can control the priority of updates in a 
	 * program by adding certain managers before others.</p>
