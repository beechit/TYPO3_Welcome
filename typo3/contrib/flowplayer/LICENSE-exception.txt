Hi Oliver,

You can use our Free version that is under our GPL 2 based license. You 
have my blessing for this and you can archive this email for any future 
needs.

Let me know if you need something more from us. I think it would make 
sense for us to include this kind of exception in our website, just like 
Sencha does.

Regards,
Anssi
