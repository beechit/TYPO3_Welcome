/**
 * Context menu
 *
 * The script is called in the top frame of the backend typically by a click on an icon for which a context menu should appear.
 * Either this script displays the context menu horizontally in the top frame or alternatively (default in MSIE, Mozilla) it writes the output to a <div>-layer in the calling document (which then appears as a layer/context sensitive menu)
 * Writing content back into a <div>-layer is necessary if we want individualized context menus with any specific content for any specific element.
 * Context menus can appear for either database elements or files
 * The input to this script is basically the "&init" var which is divided by "|" - each part is a reference to table|uid|listframe-flag.
 *
 * If you want to integrate a context menu in your scripts, please see template::getContextMenuCode()
