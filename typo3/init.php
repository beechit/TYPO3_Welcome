/**
 * TYPO3 Backend initialization
 *
 * This script is called by every backend script.
 * The script authenticates the backend user.
 * In addition this script also initializes the database and other depending on LocalConfiguration.php
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * This script exits if no user is logged in!
 * If you want the script to return even if no user is logged in,
 * you must define the constant TYPO3_PROCEED_IF_NO_USER=1
 * before you include this script.
 *
 *
 * This script does the following:
 * - extracts and defines path's
 * - includes certain libraries
 * - authenticates the user
 * - load the groupdata for the user and set filemounts / webmounts
 *
 * For a detailed description of this script, the scope of constants and variables in it,
 * please refer to the document "Inside TYPO3"
